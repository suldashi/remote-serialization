        <h1>Remote object access</h1>
        <h2>More than simple <code>JSON.stringify</code> back and forth</h2>
        <p>To access objects in different contexts, it's necessary to transform
            the remote object into a form that's easy to transport, and then back again into
            usable local form. This process is called serialization and deserialization.
            Currently, the preferred form of serialization is <code>JSON.stringify</code> and 
            ' counterpart <code>JSON.parse</code>. This process is adequate for passing around
            simple objects with primitive data types, but it's insufficient if we want to pass complex
            objects such as class instances, callbacks, etc.</p>
        <p>This project is a demonstration of a set of techniques for custom serialization and
            deserialization that supports features such as nested objects, matching class instances,
            arrays, objects, functions, symbols, and many more.</p>
        <p>The two different contexts are the browser window (this one), and a Node.js server (the project
            is running on it). The communication between the server and browser is done via WebSocket, and
            the communication protocol is a subset of JSONRPC 2.0.</p>
        <p>On top of this protocol, the project implements a set of predefined messages between the client
            and server, which aims to preserve the original type of the remote object. This is necessary
            in a language such as JavaScript, where typing is weak and many different objects are listed under
            the type of <code>'object'</code>.
        </p>
        <p>To demonstrate these features, open the browser's console.</p>
        <p>Accessing a remote object is done via the global <code>getRemoteObject(remoteObjectName)</code> function.
            The server contains a hardcoded object called <code>remoteObject</code>, and the full example to call a
            remote object is:
            <pre>let remoteObject = await getRemoteObject("remoteObject");</pre>
            If we print the <code>remoteObject</code> in the console, we will get a list of properties of different
            types. The following is an explanation of each of them and how they are passed around between contexts.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><code>fieldA: </code>This field is a <code>string</code> in the original context, therefore it'
            very easy to reproduce it on this context. The serialization is done directly via <code>JSON.stringify</code>.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>fieldB: </code>This field is a <code>number</code>. Serialization is also easy, however
            the client context needs to call <code>parseFloat</code> on it to ensure proper typing.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>fieldC: </code>This field is a <code>regexp</code>, but calling <code>typeof</code>
            on it will list it as an <code>object</code>, and running it through <code>JSON.stringify</code> directly
            will not work. For this reason, before being serialized it's turned into a string via ' <code>toString</code>
            method. When received by the browser, this string is then recreated into a <code>regexp</code> by adding
            the string to ' constructor.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>dateField: </code>This field is a <code>date</code>, but calling <code>typeof</code>
            on it will list it as an <code>object</code>. A similar process is done here to the <code>regexp</code> above.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>booleanTrue</code> and <code>booleanFalse: </code>These fields are <code>boolean</code>.
            Serialization is easy since the JSON format supoorts these types directly.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>undefinedObj: </code>This field is explicitly <code>undefined</code>, but <code>JSON.stringify</code>
            would strip this field during serialization. For this reason, the typing is preserved and is recreated on the
            client context.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>nullField: </code>Unlike <code>undefined</code>, <code>null</code> is treated as an <code>object</code>.
            For this reason, a <code>null</code> equality test is done on every object, and if any of them are <code>null</code>, this
            information is preserved when serializing.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>someNestedObject: </code>This is an explicit <code>object</code>, and while <code>JSON.stringify</code>
            supports objects, it will only list the primitive types within. For this reason, every enumerable property in
            the object is serialized separately, and the result of this serialization is sent to the client. Note that
            the object may have sub-objects, therefore the serialization is recursive. This allows us to serialize even
            deeply nested objects with class instances and functions.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>bigIntField: </code>This is a <code>bigint</code>, and the type is preserved when serializing.
            To ensure that it's not mixed up with a <code>number</code>, it's first turned into a string via <code>toString</code>
            and then back using <code>let bigIntField = BigInt(serializedBigInt)</code>.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>someMethod: </code>One of the more tricky aspects of the project was calling remote functions.
            Since returned objects may have functions in them, these needed to exist in the deserialized object as well.
            However, since the remote functions runs on a remote context, we can't take the function itself and pass it
            to the local context. Instead, a local anonymous function is created, which when called, send its params
            to the remote context. The remote context then deserializes these params and runs the remote function with
            them, and then sends the results back to the local context. In both cases, the params and the results
            need to be serialized using the process described above.<br><br>When we call a remote function in the remote
            context, it's also important to keep track of who called the remote function so that the result can be sent
            to the caller. This is done by using <code>Promises</code>. A promise is created for every call to a remote
            function, and this Promise is resolved when the remote context sends back the results via WebSocket. Each
            call to a remote function has a callingId, and the remote context will return this callingId along with
            the results of the remote function. This callingId is mapped to the local Promise, which is resolved when
            the results are returned.<br><br>A special case is also passing functions as parameters to remote functions.
            Again, we can't send the function itself, but we send a special string with a function id. The remote context
            will create a anonymous function which will send the results to the local context via WebSocket. When the message
            is received in the local context, the function id is matched to the calling function, and the local callback is
            called with the results from the remote context. In this way a local callback can be called by the remote context.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>symbolField: </code>Symbols are a special case, since their purpose is to serve as identifiers. For
            this reason, there needs to be a mapping between local symbols and remote symbols, so that deserialization and
            serialization produces the same instance. When a remote object serialzes a symbol, an id is generated for it and
            sent to the local context. The local context will create a symbol of its own with this id embedded. When using
            this local symbol as an argument for functions, the id is extracted and sent to the remote context instead of
            the symbol itself. The remote context will then use this id to match its own symbol. A provided function called
            <code>symbolCheck</code> is provided.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Two other global functions are provided, <code>disposeObject</code> and <code>disposeFunction</code>. These functions
            will remove all mappings between remote and local functions and symbols. The local object will still exist, but it
            will not be possible to call its methods or use its symbols. In addition, the remote context will also remove all
            mappings, and new calls to <code>getRemoteObject</code> will be made. Usually, <code>disposeFunction</code> does not
            need to be called directly, since <code>disposeObject</code> will usually dispose all of its attached methods as well.
            However, when we call a remote function witch itself returns a callback, this disposal is necessary since the returned
            callback is not bound to the remote object.
